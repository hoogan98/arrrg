ARRRG!
My friend and I made this while bored at work. It's a two player pirate ship fight that runs on the command line because why not.

--IMPORTANT--
To play the game, right click 'pirate.ps1' and select 'run with powershell'

Powershell might ask if you want to change your execution policy, which essentially just allows our custom script to run.
If you don't trust us you can always look at the included source code to see that this isn't a virus.

The first time you run the game, I highly reccomend you right click where it says "windows powershell" in the top
left of the window, select properties, go to the 'font' tab, and bring the font size down.  I would advise changing the text window
to font size 12 for both windows. Otherwise, the print outs don't fit on screen and everything will look weird and broken up.

The music is called "The Pirate And The Dancer" by Rolemusic. I had to convert it into a .wav file so it sounds more compressed than the
real version. If you want to hear it for real go to:

This game does work without the UI, you can just close the second powershell window that opens and everything will run normally 
(but you won't get music).




The .ps1 scripts are just the raw source code for the game, you can look at them in case you want to laugh at how bad we are at coding, 
or add stuff for some reason.
ALSO if you still can't play the game try running the following command in a new powershell window:

> Set-Executionpolicy Unrestricted

Then to play the game, navigate to the folder it is in and type

> .\pirate.ps1

I promise it's fine.  If you're worried about that, after you're done you can run:


> Set-Executionpolicy Restricted


That puts the security feature back on.
