ARRRG!
My friend and I made this while bored at work. It's a two player pirate ship fight that runs on the command line because why not.

--IMPORTANT--
To play the game, right click 'pirate.ps1' and select 'run with powershell' note that you need to have admin access to run the game.

Powershell might ask if you want to change your execution policy, which essentially just allows our custom script to run.
If you don't trust us you can always look at the included source code to see that this isn't a virus.

If the two windows don't fit on the screen very well, all you have to do is right click where it says "windows powershell" in the top
left of the window, select properties, go to the 'font' tab, and bring the font size down.  I would recommend changing the text window
to font size 12 for both windows.
--IMPORTANT--



This game does work without the UI, you can just close the second powershell window that opens and everything will run normally.




The .ps1 scripts are just the raw source code for the game, you can look at them in case you want to laugh at how bad we are at coding, 
or add stuff for some reason.
ALSO if you still can't play the game try running the command:

> Set-Executionpolicy Unrestricted

Then to play the game type

> .\pirate.ps1


I promise it's fine.  If you're worried about that, after you're done you can run:


> Set-Executionpolicy Restricted


That puts the training wheels back on.
