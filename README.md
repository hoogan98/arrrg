ARRRG
My friend and I made this while bored at work. It's a two player pirate ship fight that runs on the command line because why not.
ALSO you have to run powershell as an administrator then run the command:

```powershell
> Set-Executionpolicy Unrestricted
```

Then to play the game type
```powershell
> .\pirate.ps1
```

I promise it's fine.  If you're worried about that, after you're done you can run:

```powershell
> Set-Executionpolicy Restricted
```

That puts the training wheels back on.
