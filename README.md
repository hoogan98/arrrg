ARRRG
My friend and I made this while bored at work. It's a two player pirate ship fight that runs on the command line because why not.
ALSO you have to run the command below for powershell to not reee when you boot the game:

Set-Executionpolicy Unrestricted

Then to play the game type

.\pirate.ps1

I promise it's fine.  If you're worried about that, after you're done you can run:

Set-Executionpolicy Restricted

That puts the training wheels back on.
